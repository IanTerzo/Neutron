# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! Below are guidelines for contributing and how to get started.

## Getting Started

A good way to contribute is to work on a to-do. [to-dos](https://github.com/IanTerzo/Neutron/blob/main/TODO.md).

Another way to get started is to fix issues, you can find new issues in the issues tab.


## Pull Requests And Commits

If a small fix or update is needed feel free to do a pull request, but keep in mind the following:

- Have a good and explanatory name for your pull request, e.g. no "Fixed code" or "Added feature".

- Always test your code before pushing. (the module must work if it is cloned from source)

If you plan on implementing a new feature or changing a lot of code, please open an issue first to discuss it.
